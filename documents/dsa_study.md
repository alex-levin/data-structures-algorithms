## Implement core data structures  
Linked lists, hash table, trees  
## Implement core patterns  
Look at standard interfaces to find out which patterns to implement.  
Ex: List interface. Implement add node, remove node, reverse linked list,  
swap nodes in linked list, split linked list in two.  
Remove the node from the tree but then what to do with the remaining children?  
## Combining core patterns to solve problems  
Ex: write a function to print linked list in a reversed order.  
All we have to do is to combine a few core patterns:  
reversing a linked list, iteration over a linked list and print it.  
Think about dividing a problem into smaller core patterns.  
So many problems can solved just by combining core patterns.  
## Which data strucures do I need to study?  
Do I need to study red-black trees? Do I need to study priority queues?  
The answer is to start with the core data structures and expand out.  
If you have CTCI or Elements of Programming Interviews, look at the table of content to see which core data  
structures to study. If you don't have it, then look at the table of content on Amazon. 
After understanding core data structures, start implementing rebalancing trees and priority queues.
